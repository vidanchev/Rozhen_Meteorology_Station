# Rozhen Meteorology Station

This repo contains some code preparation for an Arduino Meteorological station which I was a an advisor for during the [first summer school on space research, technology and applications at Rozhen Observatory, Bulgaria](https://bulgarianspace.online/space-schoolbg-2021-programme/).

The programme assumed no prior knowledge with Arduino so the code is broken up into several parts starting from scratch.
